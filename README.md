# Path-Finding
A visualization of search algorithms on a hex grid. Start and end nodes as well as obstacles are set by the user. Currently, the search algorithms are still being improved. Future plans including finding paths through multiple nodes instead of a single path between 2 nodes. Currently, the Uniform-cost search, greedy search, and A* search are still being refined. Future directions include adding more pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search (DFS).
